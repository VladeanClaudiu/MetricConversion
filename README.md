## Unit Converter

This is a solution to a solo project from [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com).
Solo projects are meant to challenge the skills you've learnt so far through the courses; there is no solution given by Scrimba.

## The challenge

- The idea is that you will input a number in the code and it will spit out all of the conversions between imperial and metric in length, value and mass
- You will save a number to a variable in the code
- As soon as the app loads you will take that number and you will do calculations to display the results
- The numbers need to be rounded to 3 decimal places
- Stretch goal: add an input for the user to change the number and automatically recalculate the values when it changes

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Dark Version
- Figma design files from Scrimba
